# spicetify-hide-podcasts
[Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extension to hide podcasts, _and optionally audiobooks_. 
* Hides podcast carousels on the homepage
* Hides the podcasts tab on the Your Library page
* Hides the "Your Episodes" sidebar section
* Hides the podcasts genre card on the Search page
* Can also hide the audiobooks genre card on the Search page
## ‚öôÔ∏è Install
Copy `hidePodcasts.js` into your [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli) extensions directory:
| **Platform** | **Path**                                                                               |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.config/spicetify/Extensions/` |
| **MacOS**      | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions` or `$SPICETIFY_CONFIG/Extensions`                   |
| **Windows**    | `%appdata%/spicetify/Extensions/`                                               |

After putting the extension file into the correct folder, run the following command to install the extension:
```
spicetify config extensions hidePodcasts.js
spicetify apply
```
Note: Using the `config` command to add the extension will always append the file name to the existing extensions list. It does not replace the whole key's value.

Or you can manually edit your `config-xpui.ini` file. Add your desired extension filenames in the extensions key, separated them by the | character.
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
extensions = autoSkipExplicit.js|shuffle+.js|trashbin.js|hidePodcasts.js
```

Then run:

```
spicetify apply
```

## ü™Ñ  Usage
- Toggle in the profile menu. 
- Aggressive mode constantly watches the page for changes instead of stopping once initial load is complete. This should help if you face issues with podcast content loading in later on. 
- Hiding audiobooks requires the extension to be enabled.

## üåé Translations
I've added translations support! If you use Spotify in a non-English language and are getting the "hide podcasts" menu item etc in English, you can get your language added by either: 
- Submitting a pull request with a new copy of `src/locales/en.json` but named after your locale, with your translated content inside. 
- Or making a [new issue](https://github.com/theRealPadster/spicetify-hide-podcasts/issues/new?template=new_translation.yml) with the relevant information.
